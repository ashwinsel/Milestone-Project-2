    + #### Colour Scheme
        * I have used a rusted copper ztar color palette consistent with the backgoruns image of a ethereal astronomical image.
        * #0C3D40 a shade of dark green, black, and a dark rusty font colors play a good contrast to the chosen colour palette.

        ![Colour Scheme][def29]        

    + #### Typography
        * The Samarkan font is representative of the Sanskrit Devnagri script therefore this font was chosen for the quiz title text. As this was not available on Google Fonts library, Cdnfonts has been used to import Samarkan font into style.css.
        ![samarkan][def43]
        * Google Fonts has been used to import 'SpaceMono' and  fonts into style.css. These have been chosen as they are readable in all font weights and have a playful look but are also easy to read. These fonts also match the style of the title font.
        **Lugrasimo**
        ![lugrasimo][def45]
        **SpaceMono**
        ![spaceMono][def44]
        * Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif - have been used as a contingency fonts when the above fonts fail to load. These have been chosen due to their versatality and readability.
    + #### Imagery
        ![backgroundimage][def46]
        *   The ethereal image of the Carina Nebula, with its vast expanse of swirling gas clouds and radiant celestial bodies, evokes a sense of awe and wonder that transcends the boundaries of our earthly existence. In Hinduism, spirituality is often intertwined with the contemplation of the cosmos, where the universe is perceived as a manifestation of the divine.
        * ![favicon][def49] The favicon was designed using an online favicon generator. This has been designed with an "Om" symbol that represents Hinduism.
        * All the images used are license free or been used with owners consent. The sources are listed in the Credits section.
        * Images used were compressed using Tinypng.com for better performance and user experience.

## **Features**
------------
- ### Quiz landing page
    * ##### F1.1 Guide
        - The "Guide" function serves as a navigational element within the user interface, denoted as a menu button. Upon activation, this button initiates the deployment of a modal interface, which in turn furnishes users with comprehensive instructional content outlining the how to participate in the quiz and explain all other features. Through these guidelines, the modal interface provides the steps to play the quiz to users, thereby enhancing their overall interactive experience within the quiz environment.

        ![Guide Button][def78]

    * ##### F1.2 Music Toggle Button
        - The incorporation of background music within the web interface is configured with the attributes of autoplay and loop, facilitating a continuous and immersive auditory experience for users engaging with the platform. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that certain browser configurations may restrict the automatic playback of such audio elements. To address this potential limitation, users are provided with a dedicated music control button, enabling manual activation or deactivation of the auditory component. This toggle functionality dynamically adjusts the displayed text on the button interface in accordance with the current status of the background music, affording users intuitive control over their auditory environment.
        
        ![Music Toggle Button][def47]

    * ##### F1.3 Rest button
        - The "reset" button provides users the capability to reset the ongoing quiz at their discretion, thereby resetting the score to zero and initiating the quiz anew from question number 1. The randomized nature of question selection, ensures that subsequent quiz attempts commence with a fresh set of questions and so gives users a better experience.

        ![Reset Button][def50]
        
    * ##### F1.4 Question Box
        - The question box displays the question that is generated at random from a set of questions in the array.

        ![Right Answer][def64] ![Wrong Answer][def65]

    * ##### F1.6 Next Button
        - The Next button is not visible until the user has clicked on an answer, therefore limiting the user to proceed without answering a question. User can click on the next button to proceed to the next question. When the next question is displayed the "Next" button disappears again until an answer is clicked upon.

        ![Next Button][def66]

    * ##### F1.7 Score Display Box
        - The score display box should appear at the end of 10 attempted questions and when the ""next"" button is clicked.

    At the first instance the results for performance were low at 83%. Thereafter, on further analysis of it was identified the image files and an extra bootstrap cdn were the LCP element and unused CSS respectively. I then changed the background image file to webp format as recommended on lighthouse dev tool and removed the earlier version cdn for bootstrap.

- ## Bugs and Fixes
------------
* Score always exceeded the number of questions.
 - To fix this I console logged the clicked button event and the score event.
 - Based on the results on DOM it was obvious that even after the user has clicked on the chosen answer the code was allowing further clicks but this was invisible on the page as once a class was added to the div it was returning event listner events.
 - This was fixed by applying a specific id to each div and then calling each id.

* Instructions Modal was floating towards the top regardless of the applied CSS styling.
 - Further investigation on the developer tools I identifieds that the bootstrap and some template css were over-riding my styling.
 - This was then easy to fix by targetting the element specifically and applying !important 

* Reset Button was dissapearing when clicked on x to close guide modal
 - this was an easy fix by removing it out of modal class and removing the initial code that was causing a ghost modal to open and therefore clicking it was disabling the button itself.
 - This debugging also revealed that there were multiple event listners to reset button which was rectified.

* Music did not autoplay even though there was relevant attributes added.
 - This could not be fixed for some browsers as some of them had extensions that could stop running.
 - Reading up on codepen and W3schools this was fixed to show error if browser couldn't read the music.
 - Added afeature to be able to turn on music once the page is loaded.

* After the user has chosen the answer the right answer was not getting applied the style
 - By console.logging the elements that were being compared to check for right answer it was clear that the 
 ansArray.forEach(function(obj, c){
        if (obj.result === true){            
        rightAns = ansArray[c].ans;
        }       
        was returning an undefined value to dom
 - Also, I was targetyting the wrong elemet  evt.target.classList.add("green"); instead of the actual element. I learned that it is best to assign variables a name that is recognisable rather than "x" and will be apllied in future projects.
- This was then easily fixed by applying a loop to find the target div containing the right answer and then applying the class to the element  x.classList.add("green");.

* Score was doubling up again 
 - Realised that the element wasn't getting disabled again due to targetting the wrong element this was fixed by  x.style.button = "disable"; using the x variable to ensure I am targetting the right elements to be disabled.
 - The asnwer buttons also had two different event listners this is due me mis-understanding the event listener lesson. 

* After establishing a proper working quiz, I wanted to improve the user experience so I wanted to add few more questions and randomly pick question-answer set from the array.
 - I used the Math.floor(Math.random()) function to generate the random question number.
 - I was stuck for a while at this juncture as I couldn't get the intended result.
 - However, the console.logging the various variables and const I realised at some point the during the iterations there was always a point that returned either 0 or a number equal to the array length.
 - Once I figured out the problem I could fix it with a simple loop and break method to check the question counter before it was fed to the show question function to obtain array object at the non-existant index.

*  Score was doubling Bug
 - I used the sources feature in dev tools to resolve this.
 - stopping the function at the score calculating code.
 - This was then fixed by adding a separate counter to count the number of questions.

* Next button was extending accross the screen.
 - This was an easy fix at CSS level.

- ## Browser Compatibility
------------
* Testing has been carried out on the following browsers :
    - Chrome Version 120.0.6099.225 (Official Build) (64-bit)
    - Firefox Version 122.0 (64-bit)
    - Edge Version 121.0.2277.83 (Official build) (64-bit)
    All the functionalities and appearance works as intended on all the above browsers.
